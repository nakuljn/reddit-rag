# Project Planning & Progress Tracker

## Reddit-Powered LLM System

This document tracks all planned steps and progress for the Reddit-Powered LLM project. Completed steps are checked, and upcoming steps are listed for future work.

---

## ✅ = Completed | ⬜ = To Do

### 1. Planning & Setup
- ✅ Review high-level design (HLD) and implementation plan
- ✅ Decide on project structure and core components
- ✅ Create main project directories (`app/`, `data/`, `tests/`, `.env`, `requirements.txt`)
- ✅ Confirm outer folder structure (`reddit-rag/` with `reddit-llm/` and `Documents/`)
- ✅ Scaffold initial Python files in `app/` (`main.py`, `ingestion.py`, `search.py`, `llm.py`, `models.py`)
- ✅ Add `__init__.py` to `app/` and `tests/`
- ✅ Populate and install dependencies in `requirements.txt`
- ✅ Set up Python 3.11 virtual environment
- ✅ Implement minimal FastAPI app with root health check endpoint
- ✅ Create basic async test for FastAPI root endpoint
- ✅ Install `pytest-asyncio` for async test support
- ✅ Confirm tests run and pass
- ✅ Resolve SSH key and permission issues for GitHub
- ✅ Push code and structure to remote repository

### 2. Core Feature Development
- ✅ Implement Reddit ingestion logic in `ingestion.py`
    - ✅ Load Reddit API credentials from environment variables
    - ✅ Initialize PRAW Reddit client
    - ✅ Fetch top posts from subreddit with filtering
    - ✅ Fetch top comments for each post
    - ✅ Structure post and comments as document dict
    - ✅ Ingest subreddit end-to-end (posts + comments → docs)
    - ✅ Write and pass tests for all ingestion steps
    - ✅ Add robust error handling for invalid subreddit names, network/API failures, and empty posts/comments
    - ✅ **FIXED: Handle posts with empty selftext (common in r/askreddit)**
    - ✅ **FIXED: Metadata validation issues in ChromaDB (convert PRAW objects to strings/ints)**
    - ✅ **FIXED: Python version compatibility issues (moved to Python 3.11)**
- ✅ Store ingested data in Chroma vector DB
    - ✅ Set up ChromaDB client and collection initialization
    - ✅ Add function to store batch of documents with metadata
    - ✅ Write and pass tests for storage logic
    - ✅ **FIXED: ChromaDB metadata validation errors**
- ✅ Implement vector search logic in `search.py`
    - ✅ Add similarity search function with embedding support
    - ✅ Return structured results with metadata and distances
    - ✅ Write and pass tests for search logic
    - ✅ Add error handling for empty queries, empty results, and collection errors
- ✅ Create API endpoint for vector search
    - ✅ Add Pydantic models for request/response validation
    - ✅ Implement POST `/search` endpoint with error handling
    - ✅ Write and pass tests for API endpoint
- ✅ Integrate LLM (OpenAI) in `llm.py`
    - ✅ Create LLMService class with OpenAI client
    - ✅ Implement context building and prompt engineering
    - ✅ Add response generation with RAG prompt template
    - ✅ Write and pass tests for LLM integration
    - ✅ Add error handling for API failures, empty responses, and invalid queries
- ✅ Create API endpoint for user queries (retrieval-augmented generation)
    - ✅ Implement `/ask` endpoint for end-to-end RAG
    - ✅ Add source attribution in LLM responses
    - ✅ Write and pass tests for the full pipeline and edge cases
- ⬜ Build simple web UI (Streamlit)

### 3. Quality, Testing & Monitoring
- ✅ Add error handling and retries in ingestion and API
- ✅ Write pytest tests for ingestion, search, and LLM modules (including edge cases)
- ✅ Add environment variable management with `python-dotenv`
- ✅ Document all modules and functions (docstrings)
- ✅ Review and refactor code for type hints and best practices
- ✅ **FIXED: python-dotenv import issues**
- ✅ **FIXED: Virtual environment setup with correct Python version**
- ⬜ Implement response caching
- ⬜ Add logging and basic monitoring (structlog, log files)

### 4. Deployment & Iteration
- ⬜ Prepare deployment scripts/instructions
- ⬜ Set up cron job or scheduler for regular ingestion
- ⬜ Test end-to-end workflow
- ⬜ Gather feedback and iterate on features

## Recent Fixes & Improvements (July 2025)

### Environment & Setup Issues Resolved
- **Python Version Compatibility**: Recreated virtual environment with Python 3.11 to resolve version conflicts
- **python-dotenv Installation**: Fixed import issues by ensuring proper package installation
- **Reddit API Credentials**: Verified environment variable loading and credential validation

### Ingestion Pipeline Fixes
- **Empty Selftext Handling**: Modified filtering logic to accept posts without selftext (common in r/askreddit)
- **Metadata Validation**: Fixed ChromaDB metadata errors by converting PRAW objects to proper data types
- **Document Structure**: Improved text formatting for posts with/without content

### Current Status
- ✅ **Ingestion Pipeline**: Fully functional and tested with r/askreddit
- ✅ **Vector Storage**: ChromaDB integration working with proper metadata handling
- ✅ **API Endpoints**: All endpoints implemented and tested
- ⬜ **Web UI**: Still pending implementation
- ⬜ **Production Deployment**: Ready for deployment planning

## Notes
- Update this document as new steps are added or completed.
- Use this as a single source of truth for project planning and progress.
- As of July 2025, all core modules are robustly tested and handle edge cases gracefully.
- The ingestion pipeline is now production-ready with proper error handling and data validation.
